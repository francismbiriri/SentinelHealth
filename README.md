# SentinelHealth
The objective of this project is to transition SentinelHealth from a manual, reactive inventory model to an automated, data-driven logistics system. The system focuses on reducing high-cost expedited shipping and ensuring 100% HIPAA compliance by removing PII from the supply chain.
