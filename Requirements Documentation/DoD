## 🔴 Definition of Done (DoD)

A Jira ticket is considered **Done** only when **all** of the following acceptance criteria are satisfied:

### 🔗 Relational Integrity
- All **Foreign Key relationships** are implemented and validated between:
  - `Shipment_ID`
  - `Hospital_ID`
  - `Kit_ID`
- No orphaned records exist across shipments, hospitals, or kits.

### 📊 Visualization & Reporting
- The **Tableau Map dashboard**:
  - Correctly renders hospital locations using validated `Geo_Coordinates`
  - Applies color-coding based on the approved **Stock Urgency logic**
  - Accurately reflects underlying SQL view outputs

### 🛡️ Auditability & Compliance
- A `HIPAA_Compliance` boolean/bit field is present in the shipment record.
- Compliance status is correctly evaluated against:
  - Shipment assignment
  - Delivery timestamp
- All records are traceable without exposing PII.

### ✅ Peer Review & UAT Validation
- SQL **Audit View** results reconcile with Tableau dashboard metrics at **100% accuracy**.
- Results are reviewed and signed off by:
  - Business Analyst
  - Operations / Warehouse representative
- UAT evidence is documented and stored in Confluence.
