# Business Requirements Document (BRD)  
## SentinelHealth Logistics  
### Surgical Kit Inventory & HIPAA Compliance Modernization

**Author:** Francis Mbiriri  
**Date:** 6 February 2026  

---

## 1. Project Overview

The objective of this project is to transition **SentinelHealth** from a **manual, reactive surgical kit inventory model** to an **automated, data-driven logistics system**.

The current operating model results in:
- Excessive use of high-cost expedited shipping
- Limited inventory visibility across hospitals and warehouses
- Elevated HIPAA compliance risk due to the presence of patient-identifiable information (PII) in logistics workflows

The proposed solution focuses on:
- **Reducing shipping costs** through proactive replenishment
- **Ensuring 100% HIPAA compliance** by removing PII from the supply chain
- **Improving operational readiness** for scheduled surgical procedures

## 2. Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Role |
|------------|------|
| Warehouse Manager | Primary user of inventory alerts and stock urgency dashboards |
| Sales Agents | Initiate surgical kit requests on behalf of hospitals |
| Courier Partners | External vendors responsible for kit delivery |
| Compliance Officer | Audits workflows and validates HIPAA de-identification controls |

---

## 3. Functional Requirements (FR)

The following functional requirements define **what the system must do**, based on the approved ERD and business rules.

| ID | Requirement | Description / Logic Source |
|----|------------|-----------------------------|
| FR-01 | Automated Replenishment | The system shall query the `Kits` table every 24 hours to identify records where `Quantity_OnHand ≤ Reorder_Level`. |
| FR-02 | HIPAA De-identification | The system must use `Case_Ref_Number` as the primary reference for hospital cases. Patient names or direct identifiers shall not be stored in logistics tables. |
| FR-03 | Geospatial Tracking | The system shall map hospital locations using `Geo_Coordinates` to visualize stock urgency and fulfillment priorities. |
| FR-04 | Service Compliance Monitoring | The system must flag kits where the current date exceeds **180 days** from `Last_ServiceDate`. |

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

### 🔐 Security & Compliance
- All shipping documentation (electronic or printed) must be validated as **PII-free** before shipment closure.
- Logistics datasets must comply with HIPAA de-identification standards at all times.

### ⏱️ Availability
- The Tableau **Logistics Command Center** dashboard must be available by **6:00 AM** local time to support warehouse operations.

### 🔗 Data Integrity
- The `Shipments` table must enforce a strict **one-to-many relationship** with the `Kits` table.
- Referential integrity must be maintained to ensure audit accuracy and traceability.

---

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

The success of the SentinelHealth Logistics Modernization initiative will be measured using the following KPIs:

- **80% reduction** in expedited shipping costs by increasing usage of standard courier paths
- **Zero PII leaks**, verified through monthly audits of the `Shipments` table
- **100% surgical kit availability** for scheduled procedures through proactive replenishment and servicing

---

## 6. Key Assumptions & Constraints

- Hospitals provide accurate location data for geospatial mapping
- Courier partners consume only de-identified shipment data
- Inventory thresholds are approved and maintained by warehouse leadership

---

## 7. Approval & Sign-Off

Final approval of this BRD confirms alignment on:
- Business objectives
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Compliance and audit expectations

*Formal sign-off captured via Confluence and Jira.*
