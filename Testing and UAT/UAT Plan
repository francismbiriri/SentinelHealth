# 🧪 User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan  
## SentinelHealth Logistics Platform  
### Surgical Kit Inventory & HIPAA Compliance Modernization

---

## 1. Purpose of UAT

The purpose of User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is to confirm that the **SentinelHealth Logistics Platform** satisfies approved business requirements and is fit for operational use.

UAT validates that the system:
- Proactively identifies low surgical kit stock
- Enforces HIPAA-compliant, de-identified logistics workflows
- Accurately monitors kit servicing and compliance status
- Produces consistent and reconcilable analytics across SQL and Tableau

All tests are executed in alignment with the **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** and approved delivery standards.

---

## 2. UAT Scope

### In Scope
- Inventory replenishment logic
- HIPAA de-identification controls
- Kit servicing and compliance tracking
- Geospatial visualization of hospital stock urgency
- Shipping cost analytics and reporting accuracy

### Out of Scope
- Courier operational performance
- Physical warehouse handling processes
- External hospital system integrations

---

## 3. Test Environment

**Database**
- Microsoft SQL Server (Dedicated Test Environment)

**Reporting & Visualization**
- Tableau Dashboard connected to validated test data

**Test Management & Evidence**
- Jira for defect logging and status tracking
- Confluence for test cases, screenshots, and sign-off records

---

## 4. UAT Test Scenarios

| Test Case ID | Scenario | Test Action | Expected Outcome |
|--------------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| UAT-01 | HIPAA De-Identification | Create a new shipment record and inspect all logistics tables for PII fields. | No patient names or identifiers are present. Only `Case_Ref_Number` is stored and visible. |
| UAT-02 | Low Stock Alert Logic | Set `Quantity_OnHand = 1` for a kit with `Reorder_Level = 2`. | The replenishment SQL view flags the kit as **Low Stock** and eligible for proactive replenishment. |
| UAT-03 | Service Compliance Monitoring | Update `Last_ServiceDate` to exceed 180 days from the current date. | The kit is flagged as **NON-COMPLIANT – Service Overdue**. |
| UAT-04 | Geospatial Accuracy | Load SQL output into Tableau and validate hospital positioning. | Hospital locations display accurately using stored `Geo_Coordinates`. |
| UAT-05 | Shipping Cost Analysis | Filter dashboard by `Shipment_Type` (`Standard` vs `Expedited`). | Tableau correctly calculates and displays shipping cost differences. |

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

UAT is considered **successfully completed** when all of the following criteria are met:

- All HIPAA-related test cases achieve a **100% pass rate**
- Low stock alerts are validated and approved by the **Warehouse Manager**
- Tableau dashboards reconcile **exactly** with underlying SQL views
- All defects are logged, resolved, and formally closed in Jira
- UAT evidence and approvals are documented in Confluence

---

## 6. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Business Analyst | Test coordination, validation, and traceability |
| Warehouse Manager | Operational validation and sign-off |
| Compliance Officer | HIPAA controls verification |
| Data / Systems Analyst | SQL validation and data reconciliation |

---

## 7. UAT Sign-Off

Successful sign-off confirms that:
- Business and compliance requirements have been met
- Data accuracy and reporting integrity are validated
- The system is approved for production deployment

*Formal approval is recorded in Confluence.*
